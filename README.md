# API Planning Notes

Maybe not asbind? Yes, as bind it matches up with what wasm bndgen says

Only supports the `--runtime full`, and `--runtime stub` flag. And should, because anything else would mean that you DO NOT want to create objects externally to your wasm module.

Simply need to wrap the docs from: https://docs.assemblyscript.org/details/runtime and we should be good to go!
